CP-Ti chip produced at GT. Chip was etched to reveal grain boundary. Optical microscopy can only achieve so much resolution but this image on the scale of the chip is useful for qualitatively observing the heterogeneity of the chip.

The simplest physical model for the continuum problem is the orthogonal cutting assumption. This plane strain model was used early in the study of machining to develop models for predicting cutting forces and temperatures. Today it is still used for solid modeling in FEA for developing material models. From there complex operations such as drilling or oblique cutting can be performed.
