## Background

Machining (turning, milling, planing, drilling, etc..) is a common subtractive manufacturing process used to give products desired shapes. Material removal occurs due to intense shearing which induces failure at the tool-workpiece interface. The induced shearing produces chips as well as a new machined surface which may contain structuralal changes relative to the initial bulk material.

A CP-Ti chip produced at GT is shown below. The chip was etched to reveal structure (grain/twin boundaries). Optical microscopy can only achieve so much resolution however even at this scale the chip is useful for qualitatively observing the heterogeneity of the chip.

The simplest physical model for the continuum problem is the orthogonal cutting simplification. This plane strain model was used early in the study of machining to develop models for predicting cutting forces and temperatures. Today it is still used for solid modeling in FEA for developing material models. From there complex operations such as drilling or oblique cutting can be simulated.

The degree of strain can be controlled through the geometric quantities shown in the below image. Strain rate can be controlled through the prescribed cutting velocity. The temperatures generated in this process are a function of both the imposed deformation and associated time scale (disipated deformation energy). These independent variables allow for tailoring of the process to achieve different structure/properties.

Recent work by several authors ([Brown et al.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actamat.2009.07.052), [Swaminathan et. al.](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921509305008166), [Swaminathan et al.](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359646207001571)) have begun to quantify the relationship between processing and deformed microstructure in machining operations. There is also an increasing push towards including structure-property linkages in model development ([Ding et al.](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927025611002850), [Ding & Shin](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmatprotec.2012.12.016)).
